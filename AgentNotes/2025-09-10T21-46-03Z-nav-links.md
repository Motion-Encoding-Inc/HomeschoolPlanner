## Task
Adjust the top navigation bar buttons to Blog, About Us, and Contact Us.

## Initial considerations
* Nav changes in marketing pages under docs/ and HomeschoolPlanner.Api/wwwroot/marketing/.
* Blog links to Blogspot homepage (external).
* About Us will link to future about page; link stub.
* Need Contact Us page; mirror in both docs and marketing.
* Update header nav to only include Blog, About Us, Contact Us plus existing theme toggle.
* Run dotnet build and test after changes.
## Follow-up (2025-09-10 21:50 UTC)
* Locate nav bar in docs/index.html and marketing index; plan to replace existing nav links.
* Will remove "How it works", "Features", "Pricing", and "Demo" nav items; add Blog, About Us, Contact Us.
* Create placeholder contact pages under docs/ and marketing/ with matching nav and footer.
## Follow-up (2025-09-10 22:05 UTC)
* Replaced nav links in docs/index.html and marketing index with Blog, About Us, Contact Us.
* Removed "See mobile preview" button from nav.
* Updated docs index footer to match new links.
* Created mirrored contact pages under docs/contact.html and marketing/contact.html with matching header/footer and theme toggle.
## Results
* Updated marketing and docs navigation to Blog/About/Contact and mirrored footer.
* Added placeholder contact pages with theme toggle and footer.
* Installed .NET SDK via script to run builds/tests; `dotnet build` and `dotnet test` succeeded.
* Confidence: 0.87
