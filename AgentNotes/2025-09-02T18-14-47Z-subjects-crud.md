## Task
Subjects: entity + Create/List
- Why: Learners need containers for resources.
- Add: Entities/Subject.cs (Id, LearnerId, Title, ColorHex?, CreatedUtc).
- DbContext: DbSet<Subject> + index (LearnerId, Title).
- Endpoints:
   - POST /api/v1/subjects → create (validate: Title, existing LearnerId).
   - GET /api/v1/subjects?learnerId={guid} → list.
- Program.cs: uncomment the two subject routes.
- DoD: Can create a subject for a learner and list it. Swagger/manual smoke passes

## Initial considerations
* Need to add EF entity Subject with optional ColorHex, CreatedUtc.
* Need to ensure index on (LearnerId, Title) uniqueness? The user says 'index', maybe not unique. We'll use an index; maybe unique to avoid duplicates? But user only asked for index; we can create HasIndex(learnerId, Title). Should we mark as unique? unspecified; may be unique to avoid duplicates. We'll see existing patterns.
* Validate Title non-empty; ensure Learner exists (probably via referencing in DB with FK). Must check existing Learner entity.
* Need to add endpoints: POST create with validation, GET list by learnerId.
* Update Program.cs to include MapPost/MapGet for subject routes (uncomment). Search for comments.
* Need to add migration for Subject table; configure DbContext accordingly.
* Need to create tests: minimal integration tests (smoke). For DoD, they want manual & swagger; but repository instructions: run dotnet test. We'll add integration tests in HomeschoolPlanner.Api.Tests: for creating and listing subjects? They may have existing tests for learners; we add new tests for subject endpoints.
* Ensure to run migrations; maybe create new migration with dotnet ef; update DB? For tests maybe they use in-memory; but still we need to update DB context; in tests, they may create ephemeral DB. We'll ensure tests pass.
* Need to read AGENTS instructions for Api and Domain subdirectories. We'll ensure code style (maybe with both). We'll check for AGENTS in subdirectories.
## Work log
* Installed .NET SDK 9.0 and dotnet-ef tool, set PATH and DOTNET_ROOT for EF migrations.
* Added Subject entity file and removed inline definition from AppDbContext.
* Added index for (LearnerId, Title) in DbContext and created migrations.
* Implemented SubjectEndpoints with create/list logic and validation.
* Uncommented subject routes in Program.cs.
* Added integration tests for subject create/list.
* Updated requests.http with subject examples.
* Generated EF migration and updated database.
* Ran dotnet restore/build/test successfully.

## Results
* Subject entity and CRUD endpoints work with validation.
* Migration created and tests pass.
* Confidence: ~0.87.
