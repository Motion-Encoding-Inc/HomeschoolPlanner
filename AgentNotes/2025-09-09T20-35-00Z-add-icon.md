## Task
Add Ico image as icon next to Scholar's Forge Planner in header and footer, color box adapts to Scholar/Forge mode, and use same image as webpage tab icon.

## Initial considerations
* Icon file `images/ico.png` exists.
* Header/footer located in `docs/index.html`.
* Favicon needed for marketing pages (`docs/*.html`).
* Ensure color box keeps theme backgrounds and icon overlays.
* Run `dotnet test` after changes.

## Follow-up (2025-09-09 20:37 UTC)
* Added favicon link in `docs/index.html`.
* Inserted `ico.png` within header/footer `.mark` and styled `.mark img`.
* Updated `docs/day.html`, `docs/week.html`, and `docs/demo/index.html` to use shared favicon.
* Next: run tests and commit.

## Results
* Header/footer brand now show `ico.png` inside themed box.
* All marketing pages reference `ico.png` as favicon.
* `dotnet test` passes.
* Confidence: 0.86.
