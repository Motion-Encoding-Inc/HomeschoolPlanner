## Task
Refine the marketing home page per client: more whitespace, real carousel, lighter feel. Update index.html, landing.css/js in marketing and docs.

## Initial considerations
* Need to follow AGENTS instructions (logging etc.)
* Mirror changes into docs for GitHub Pages.
* Ensure JS carousel rotates; CSS uses provided style; hero replaced.
* Run tests: repository may not have tests but run recommended commands.

## Follow-up (2025-09-08 01:49 UTC)
* Searched repo for existing marketing files; none found.
* Will create marketing directories in API/wwwroot and docs with index.html, landing.css, landing.js using provided content.
* Will run dotnet build and test after changes.
## Follow-up (2025-09-08 02:05 UTC)
* Created marketing folder with index.html, landing.css, landing.js including carousel.
* Mirrored the same files under docs/ for GitHub Pages.
* Moved previous docs index to docs/demo/index.html to keep demo links.
## Results
* Updated marketing landing with spacious styling and rotating carousel, mirrored to docs for GitHub Pages.
* Tests built and ran via .NET 9 SDK (installed manually).
* Confidence: 0.86
