## Task
We nee to embed the blogspot page via a responsive iframe:
```
<main class="container" style="padding:32px 0">
  <div style="position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;border:1px solid var(--border);border-radius:14px;overflow:hidden">
    <iframe src="https://YOURBLOG.blogspot.com/?m=1"
            title="Scholars Forge Blog" loading="lazy"
            style="position:absolute;inset:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0">
    </iframe>
  </div>
  <p class="muted" style="margin-top:8px">
    Having issues? <a href="https://scholarsforge.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open blog in a new tab</a>
  </p>
</main>
```

This likely will need to be put in a `/blog/index.html`

We will be moving from this onto rendering recent posts with Blogger Jsn/Atom feed inside out page, but that will come later. If you want to set up the infrastructure for doing that, not problem, but our links should interact with our iframe page.

## Initial considerations
* Need to locate AGENTS instructions for docs or blog directories before editing files.
* Likely create new `docs/blog/index.html` with responsive iframe markup and ensure styling/class usage matches site conventions.
* Verify existing navigation links (maybe previously added) point to `/blog/` and ensure they interact with new page.
* Consider future feed integration; maybe include TODO comment or structure to allow script addition later.
* Ensure static site build or hosting (probably GitHub Pages) picks up new file; check existing docs structure for layout/template.

## Work log (14:12 UTC)
* Reviewed existing static site structure under `docs/` and noted blog links currently point externally.
* Identified need for nested `/docs/blog/index.html` referencing shared assets via relative paths and updating nav/footer links across pages.
* Added `docs/blog/index.html` mirroring shared layout assets with relative paths and embedding the Blogger mobile view via responsive iframe.
* Updated top navigation and footer links on existing marketing pages to target the new embedded blog instead of the external Blogger URL.

## Results
* Added responsive `/blog/` page that embeds Blogger mobile view while preserving shared theming and navigation controls.
* Updated navigation/footer links across marketing pages to open the internal blog iframe experience; ready for future feed integration work.
* Added a safeguard on `docs/about.html` to rewrite any lingering Blogger links to `/blog/` so the about page always routes through the embedded experience.
* Tests: not run (static HTML change only).
* Confidence: ~0.9 â€” verified paths and relative asset references locally.
## Follow-up (2025-09-17 15:10 UTC)
* User requested that all remaining Blogger links on the About page also route to the new embedded `/blog/` page.
* Plan: audit `docs/about.html` content for external Blogger URLs and update them to `/blog/`. Re-run manual checks to ensure no stray links remain.
* (15:16 UTC) Audited docs/about.html for any remaining Blogger URLs and added a guard script to rewrite stray blogspot anchors to the internal /blog/ page while removing target/rel attributes.
