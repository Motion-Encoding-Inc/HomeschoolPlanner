## Task
Change navbar "Scholar's Forge Planner" link to point to index page instead of site root.

## Initial considerations
* Brand links in docs and marketing pages use `href="/"`, but root doesn't resolve to page.
* Need to update both icon and text link anchors to `index.html`.
* After changes run `dotnet build` and `dotnet test`.
## Follow-up (2025-09-10 22:42 UTC)
* Updated brand anchors in docs and marketing pages to `index.html` with explanatory comments.
* Installed .NET SDK and ran `dotnet build` and `dotnet test` to verify changes.

## Results
* Brand text and icon now navigate to the index page, avoiding broken root links.
* `dotnet build` and `dotnet test` both succeeded.
* Confidence: 0.88
