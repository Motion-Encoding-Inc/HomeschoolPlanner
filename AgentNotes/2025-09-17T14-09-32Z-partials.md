## Task
Create two partials and inject them into every page at load.

## Initial considerations
* Need to add header/footer partial HTML files under docs/partials.
* Must insert injection scaffolding into each docs HTML page, ensuring script fetch paths work both at root and nested.
* Need to follow repo instructions: log steps, comment as needed, run relevant tests (likely none for static docs) but maybe no automated tests.
* Must ensure script inserted after <body> start and before </body> end, avoid duplicating existing header/footer.

## Log
* 14:11 UTC: Reviewed repository instructions and existing docs structure.
* 14:12 UTC: Created docs/partials directory for shared fragments.
* 14:13 UTC: Added header and footer partial HTML files per provided markup.
* 14:18 UTC: Updated each docs HTML page to swap inline nav/footer with placeholders and async partial loader, adding theme toggle helper to avoid race conditions.
* 14:24 UTC: Enhanced loader script to rewrite relative links for nested paths and reused across pages; added landing.css and theme bootstrap to demo/day/week pages.

## Results
* Injected reusable header/footer partials and loader across docs pages, ensuring nav/theme work after async load via shared helper and guard logic.
* Added shared CSS/theme bootstrap to demo/day/week so partial styling and theme persistence stay consistent.
* Confident ~0.85 that relative path adjustments cover current hosting scenarios; monitor if additional path roots emerge.
