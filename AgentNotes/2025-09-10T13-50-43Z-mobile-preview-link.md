## Task
We need to hook up the button for C-Mobile Preview and try the today week preview to hook up to the week.html. That page needs to be hooked up so we can start working on it.

## Initial considerations
- Landing page buttons should point directly to the Week Preview demo for quicker access.
- Update both the docs and marketing copies.
- Run `dotnet test` after changes.

## Follow-up (2025-09-10 14:00 UTC)
- Updated docs and marketing landing pages to point buttons directly to Week Preview demo.
- Added inline comments explaining new links.
- Next: run `dotnet test`.

## Results
- Buttons route directly to Week Preview demo.
- `dotnet test` passed (4 tests).
- Confidence: 0.9

## Follow-up (2025-09-10 15:24 UTC)
- Adjust landing page hero CTA to promote December beta.
- Link should scroll to #beta section.
- Will run `dotnet test` after changes.


## Results (2025-09-10 15:27 UTC)
- Hero CTA now reads "Join the December beta" linking to #beta.
- `/root/.dotnet/dotnet test` passed (4 tests).
- Confidence: 0.9
